// Version 51

// Compass Code and alpha data etc inspired and adapted from HTML5 for the Mobile Web: Device Orientation Events

// Map code is based completely on Google Maps Platform Geocoding Service code. Only a few lines of adjustments and additions
// Couldn't have had this functionalit without it, although I don't realy understand the code that well. Just well enough to
// Impliment the things I needed. Relevant code marked between two comments which say (// GMP - GS Start) and (// GMP - GS End)
